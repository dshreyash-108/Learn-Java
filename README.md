# Learn-Java

I'll be commiting some codes here. It'll be helpful for those who already know a little bit programming things.

### This will be helpful for:

1. Java interview rounds
2. Revision various important java concepts
3. Java coding tests

### Resources:

Using multiple resources from internet because a single resource seems a little less.
