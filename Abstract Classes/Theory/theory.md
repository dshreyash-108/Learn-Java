In Java, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from and is typically used to define common behavior and properties that subclasses can share. Here are the key aspects and principles of abstract classes in Java:

1. **Abstract Class Declaration**:

   - An abstract class is declared using the `abstract` keyword.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public abstract class Animal {
         // Abstract methods, regular methods, and fields can be defined here
     }
     ```

2. **Abstract Methods**:

   - Abstract classes may contain abstract methods, which are methods declared without a body (no implementation).
   - Subclasses of an abstract class must provide implementations for all abstract methods unless they are also abstract.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public abstract class Animal {
         public abstract void makeSound();
     }
     ```

3. **Non-abstract Methods**:

   - Abstract classes can also have regular methods (methods with a body) that are inherited by subclasses.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public abstract class Animal {
         public abstract void makeSound();

         public void eat() {
             System.out.println("Animal is eating");
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Instantiation and Usage**:

   - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly with the `new` keyword because they are incomplete (due to abstract methods lacking implementation).
   - Example (attempting to instantiate):
     ```java
     Animal animal = new Animal(); // This would result in a compilation error
     ```

5. **Subclassing**:

   - Subclasses of an abstract class must either provide implementations for all abstract methods or be declared abstract themselves.
   - Example of a concrete subclass:
     ```java
     public class Dog extends Animal {
         @Override
         public void makeSound() {
             System.out.println("Woof");
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Use Cases**:

   - Abstract classes are useful when you want to define a template for a group of related classes, ensuring common behavior or properties are implemented consistently across subclasses.
   - They help in achieving abstraction and polymorphism in Java programs.

7. **Interfaces vs Abstract Classes**:
   - Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while interfaces can only have abstract methods (before Java 8).
   - Interfaces support multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces), whereas a class can extend only one abstract class.

In summary, abstract classes in Java provide a way to define a common interface and default behavior for subclasses while enforcing implementation of specific methods. They are an important tool for achieving abstraction and designing class hierarchies in object-oriented programming.
