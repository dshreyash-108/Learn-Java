### Explanation:

1. **Abstract Class `Troop`:**

   - Represents a generic troop in Clash of Clans with attributes `name`, `size`, and `damage`.
   - Has a constructor to initialize these attributes.
   - Declares an abstract method `attack()` for defining attack behavior.
   - Provides concrete methods `training()` to simulate troop training and `displayInfo()` to display troop information.

2. **Concrete Subclass `DefenseTroop`:**

   - Extends `Troop` and adds an additional attribute `speed`.
   - Implements the `attack()` method specific to defense troops by printing a message about attacking defenses first with the specified speed.

3. **Main Class `ClashOfClans`:**
   - Demonstrates the use of abstract class `Troop` and its concrete subclass `DefenseTroop`.
   - Creates an instance of `DefenseTroop` named `giant` with specific attributes.
   - Calls methods like `attack()` and `displayInfo()` on the `giant` instance to demonstrate its behavior as a defense troop.

This example illustrates how abstract classes and inheritance can be used to model different types of troops in Clash of Clans. The `Troop` abstract class defines common attributes and behaviors shared among all troops, while the `DefenseTroop` subclass provides specific implementation details for defense-oriented troops. The `ClashOfClans` class showcases polymorphism by treating `giant` as a `Troop` instance, allowing it to access and execute behavior defined in the abstract class and overridden in the concrete subclass.
